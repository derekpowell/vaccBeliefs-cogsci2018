abstract = {The roots of swarm intelligence are deeply embedded in the biological study of self-organized behaviors in social insects. From the routing of traffic in telecommunication networks to the design of control algorithms for groups of autonomous robots, the collective behaviors of these animals have inspired many of the foundational works in this emerging research field. For the first issue of this journal dedicated to swarm intelligence, we review the main biological principles that underlie the organization of insects’ colonies. We begin with some reminders about the decentralized nature of such systems and we describe the un- derlying mechanisms of complex collective behaviors of social insects, from the concept of stigmergy to the theory of self-organization in biological systems.We emphasize in partic- ular the role of interactions and the importance of bifurcations that appear in the collective output of the colony when some of the system’s parameters change. We then propose to categorize the collective behaviors displayed by insect colonies according to four functions that emerge at the level of the colony and that organize its global behavior. Finally, we ad- dress the role of modulations of individual behaviors by disturbances (either environmental or internal to the colony) in the overall flexibility of insect colonies. We conclude that fu- ture studies about self-organized biological behaviors should investigate such modulations to better understand how insect colonies adapt to uncertain worlds.},

@article{Weisman2017,
abstract = {Cogent explanations are an indispensable means of providing new information and an essential component of effective education. Beyond this, we argue that there is tremendous untapped potential in using explanations to motivate behavior change. In this article we focus on health interventions. We review four case studies that used carefully tailored explanations to address gaps and misconceptions in people's intuitive theories, providing participants with a conceptual framework for understanding how and why some recommended behavior is an effective way of achieving a health goal. These case studies targeted a variety of health-promoting behaviors: (1) children washing their hands to prevent viral epidemics; (2) parents vaccinating their children to stem the resurgence of infectious diseases; (3) adults completing the full course of an antibiotic prescription to reduce antibiotic resistance; and (4) children eating a variety of healthy foods to improve unhealthy diets. Simply telling people to engage in these behaviors has been largely ineffective-if anything, concern about these issues is mounting. But in each case, teaching participants coherent explanatory frameworks for understanding health recommendations has shown great promise, with such theory-based explanations outperforming state-of-the-art interventions from national health authorities. We contrast theory-based explanations both with simply listing facts, information, and advice and with providing a full-blown educational curriculum, and argue for providing the minimum amount of information required to understand the causal link between a target behavior and a health outcome. We argue that such theory-based explanations lend people the motivation and confidence to act on their new understanding.},

abstract = {Belief polarization occurs when 2 people with opposing prior beliefs both strengthen their beliefs after observing the same data. Many authors have cited belief polarization as evidence of irrational behavior. We show, however, that some instances of polarization are consistent with a normative account of belief revision. Our analysis uses Bayesian networks to characterize different kinds of relationships between hypotheses and data, and distinguishes between cases in which normative reasoners with opposing beliefs should both strengthen their beliefs, cases in which both should weaken their beliefs, and cases in which one should strengthen and the other should weaken his or her belief. We apply our analysis to several previous studies of belief polarization and present a new experiment that suggests that people tend to update their beliefs in the directions predicted by our normative account.

abstract = "Objective
The aim of this study was to explore how attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional medicine influence CAM use in a healthy population, and how health locus of control and exercise further affect CAM use.
Design
A cross-sectional survey design was used.
Participants
The sample consisted of 65 healthy graduate students.
Main Outcome Measures
Since previous studies have focused on the attitudes of medical providers toward CAM, there are currently no standard, widely used measures of attitudes toward CAM from the perspective of the healthcare recipient. Thus, a new measure, the Complementary, Alternative, and Conventional Medicine Attitudes Scale (CACMAS) was created to address how attitudes of healthcare recipients affect CAM use. The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC) was used to investigate effects of health locus of control on CAM use, and participants reported which of 17 listed CAM treatments they had used in the past, were currently using, or would likely use in the future. Participants also reported days of exercise in the past month to explore if those engaging in healthy behaviors might report more CAM use.
Results
Having a philosophical congruence with CAM and agreement with holistic balance was associated with increased CAM use. Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine was also related to increased CAM use, but to a lesser extent. Those attributing health to personal behaviors (an internal health locus of control) reported more CAM use, as did those engaging in more resistance training in the previous month."

@article{Williamson2001,
abstract = {By identifying and pursuing analogies between causal and logical in uence I show how the Bayesian network formalism can be applied to reasoning about logical deductions. Despite the fact that logic itself is about certainty, logical reasoning takes place in a context of very little certainty. In fact the very search for a proof of a proposition is usually a search for certainty: we are unsure about the proposition and want to become sure by nding a proof or a refutation. Even the search for a better proof takes place under uncertainty: we are sure of the conclusion but not of the alternative premises or lemmas. Uncertainty is rife in mathematics, for instance. A good mathematician is one who can assess which conjectures are likely to be true, and from where a proof of a conjecture is likely to emerge which hypotheses, intermediary steps and proof techniques are likely to be required and are most plausible in themselves. Mathematics is not a list of theorems but a web of beliefs, and mathematical propositions are constantly being evaluated on the basis of the mathematical and physical evidence available at the time. 1 Of course logical reasoning has many other applications, notably throughout the eld of articial intelligence. Planning a decision, parsing a sentence, checking a computer program, maintaining consistency of a knowledge base and deriving predictions from a model are only few of the tasks that can be considered theorem-proving problems. Finding a proof is rarely an easy matter, thus automated theorem proving and automated proof planning are important areas of active research. 2 However, current systems do not tackle uncertainty in any fundamental way. I will argue in this paper that Bayesian networks are particularly suited as a formalism for logical reasoning under uncertainty, just as they are for causal reasoning},
